Dr. Kuldeep Meel is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in School of Computing at the National University of Singapore. He received his Ph.D. (2017) and M.S. (2014) degree in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence and Formal Methods) from Rice University. He holds B. Tech. (with Honors) degree (2012) in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.

Dr. Meel's research interests lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Formal Methods. The broader goal of his research is to advance artificial intelligence techniques, which utilize ubiquity of data and formal methods, to enable computing to deal with increasingly uncertain real-world environments. Besides his primary research program, Meel has worked on other applications of data science and constrained reasoning including interpretable classification rules, hardware verification, validation of distributed synchronization protocol, automatic data layout generation, program synthesis, and probabilistic programming.

Dr. Meel has co-presented tutorials at top-tier AI conferences, UAI 2016 and AAAI 2017. His work received the 2014 Outstanding Masters Thesis Award from Vienna Center of Logic and Algorithms and Best Student Paper Award at CP 2015. He received the IBM Ph.D. Fellowship and the Lodieska Stockbridge Vaughn Fellowship for his work on constrained sampling and counting.
