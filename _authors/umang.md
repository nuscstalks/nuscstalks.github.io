Umang Mathur is an Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore; he received his PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and was an NTT Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at Berkeley. His research broadly centres on developing techniques inspired from formal methods and logic for answering design, analysis and implementation questions in programming languages, software engineering and systems. He was a recipient of a Google PhD Fellowship, an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ESEC/FSE'18. Best Paper Award at ASPLOS'22 and was invited as a Young Researcher at the 8th Heidelberg Laureate Forum.

Umang is nervous about this talk, especially given the previous excellent colloquium by Seth Gilbert that has implicitly set very high expectations.
