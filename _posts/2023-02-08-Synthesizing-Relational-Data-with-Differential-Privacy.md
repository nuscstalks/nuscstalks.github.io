Synthesizing Relational Data with Differential Privacy

## Abstract
Providing access to sensitive data while preserving privacy is an important problem in the era of big data. A canonical solution to this problem is to replace the sensitive data with synthetic data that follow a similar distribution but do not reveal private information. In this talk, I will introduce our research efforts towards synthesizing relational data under differential privacy, which is a rigorous privacy framework with strong privacy guarantees. In particular, I will first present a method for synthesizing a single relational table, and then describe a more advanced technique for tackling the case of multiple tables with foreign key constraints. I will conclude the talk with directions for future work.
