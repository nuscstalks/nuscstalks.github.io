A Simple Vision for Fair Division


## Abstract
We present recent results on simple algorithms for the fair allocation of indivisible resources. We advocate for the use of simple algorithmic techniques - i.e. ones that are easy to implement and understand by non-expert stakeholders - in real-world applications. 

We focus on two high-impact application domains: assigning course seats to university students, and assigning academic reviewers to papers in large CS conferences.The mechanisms we propose are rather intuitive, but through either combinatorial preprocessing, or careful analysis, we show that they are able to provide strong fairness guarantees, as well as high social welfare.

Based on joint works with Nawal Benabbou, Mithun Chakraborty, Ayumi Igarashi, Justin Payan and Vignesh Viswanathan.
