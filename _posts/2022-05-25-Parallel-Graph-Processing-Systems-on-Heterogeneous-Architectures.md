Parallel Graph Processing Systems on Heterogeneous Architectures
 
## Abstract
Graphs are de facto data structures for many data processing applications, and their volume is ever growing. Many graph processing tasks are computation intensive and/or memory intensive. Therefore, we have witnessed a significant amount of effort in accelerating graph processing tasks with heterogeneous architectures like GPUs, FPGAs and even ASIC. In this talk, we will first review the literatures of large graph processing systems on heterogeneous architectures. Next, we present our research efforts, and demonstrate the significant performance impact of hardware-software co-design on designing high performance graph computation systems and applications. Finally, we outline the research agenda on challenges and opportunities in the system and application development of future graph processing. More details about our research can be found at http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/.
