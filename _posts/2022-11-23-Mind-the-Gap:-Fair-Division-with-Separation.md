Mind the Gap: Fair Division with Separation

## Abstract
The fair allocation of limited resources is a fundamental problem in society. While the problem of fair division has been studied by economists for several decades, thanks in part to computer scientists, this area is perhaps more active currently than ever before.
In the first part of this talk, I will discuss my work on fair division with separation constraints, such as those arising from social distancing guidelines. Although it is sometimes impossible to allocate a proportional share to every agent under a separation requirement, we show that for a one-dimensional resource (such as space along a street), the criterion of maximin share fairness can always be attained. We also consider more complex resources, including two-dimensional resources (such as land) and graphical resources (such as road networks), and show that even though maximin share fairness itself may be too demanding, an ordinal relaxation of it can provide meaningful guarantees. This part is based on joint work with Edith Elkind and Erel Segal-Halevi.  
In the second part, I will provide some samples of my recent and ongoing research, which connects fair division with areas ranging from combinatorics to differential privacy. I will also discuss my work on fairness in voting and participatory budgeting settings.
