Recent Developments in DASH â€“ Low Latency and CMCD

## Abstract
In this talk we focus on two recent areas of interest in Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH).
The first is the rise in live streaming, which has led to significant pursuits to lower and optimize the endto-end latency. The second area explores the recently published Common Media Client Data (CMCD)
standard which provides better, and more standardized, insights into large-scale streaming systems.
Live streaming remains a challenge in the adaptive streaming space due to the stringent requirements for not just quality and rebuffering, but also latency. Many solutions have been proposed to tackle streaming in general, but only few have looked into better catering to the more challenging low-latency live streaming scenarios. We describe our work on low latency, called Low-on-Latency (LoL and LoL+), in
adaptive streaming systems to enhance the low-latency performance.

In September 2020, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) published the CTA-5004: Common
Media Client Data (CMCD) specification. Using this specification, a media client can convey certain
information to the content delivery network servers with object requests. This information is useful in log association/analysis, quality of service/experience monitoring and delivery enhancements. We will provide an overview of CMCD, followed by a short investigation of the feasibility of CMCD in addressing one of the most common problems in the streaming domain: efficient use of shared bandwidth by multiple clients. To that effect, we implemented CMCD functions on an HTTP server and built a proof-ofconcept system with CMCD-aware dash.js clients. We show that even a basic bandwidth allocation scheme enabled by CMCD reduces rebuffering rate and duration without noticeably sacrificing the video quality.
