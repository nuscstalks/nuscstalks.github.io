Foundations of lattice-based cryptography


## Abstract
Lattice-based cryptographic schemes have generated a lot of interest in recent years. These are schemes whose security relies on the computational hardness of computational problems over geometric objects called lattices. These schemes have been used to build advanced cryptographic primitives such as fully-homomorphic encryption and they are believed to be resistant to quantum attacks. Given the recent advancement in quantum technologies, many institutes such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and a German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) have initiated a process for standardization and deployment of lattice-based schemes widely over the next few years. The security of these schemes crucially relies on the assumption that the best-known algorithms for the corresponding lattice problems cannot be improved. In this talk, I will describe the state of the art of this assumption. In particular, I will describe the fastest known algorithms for these problems, and fine-grained hardness results that provide some complexity-theoretic evidence for the security of these cryptosystems. 


## Biodata
Dr Divesh Aggarwal is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and a Principal Investigator in the Centre for Quantum Technologies, at National University of Singapore. Prior to joining NUS, he was a postdoctoral researcher in EPFL, and in NYU. He received his PhD from the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich. His primary research interests are in the foundations of lattice-based cryptography, and in pseudorandomness. He is also more broadly interested in computational complexity and coding theory.
