Resource Optimization for Moving Target Tracking and Remote Sensing Using Minimum Flow Algorithm and Identifying Codes 

## Abstract
In this talk we will discuss two resource optimization problems, one in the domain of moving target tracking with mobile trackers (e.g., drones) and the other in the domain of remote sensing using satellites as sensors. Target tracking problems have been studied extensively by researchers in the last few years. However, the problem of continuous tracking of a set of mobile targets using the fewest number of mobile trackers, even when the trajectories of all the targets are known in advance, has received little attention. In this talk we discuss this problem, where the goal is to find the fewest number of trackers needed to track all the targets for the entire period of observation. Specifically, given a set of targets moving in different (known) trajectories in a two (or three) dimensional space, the objective is to find the fewest number of velocity-bounded trackers (e.g., UAVs) and their trajectories, so that all the targets are tracked during the entire period of observation. We formulate the problem as a network flow problem and find the solution utilizing minimum flow computation technique. We present both analytical and simulation results for our solution technique.
In the second part of the talk, we discuss a monitoring (remote sensing) problem on the surface of the earth for significant environmental, social/political, and extreme events using satellites as sensors. We assume that the surface of the earth is divided into a set of regions, where a region may be a continent, a country, or a set of neighboring countries. We also assume that the impact of a significant event spills into neighboring regions and there will be corresponding indicators of such events. Careful deployment of sensors, utilizing Identifying Codes, can ensure that even though the number of deployed sensors is fewer than the number of regions, it may be possible to uniquely identify the region where the event has taken place. We assume that an event is confined to a region. As Earth is almost a sphere, we use a soccer ball (a sphere) as a model. From the model, we construct a Soccer Ball Graph (SBG), and show that the SBG has at least 26 sets of Identifying Codes of cardinality 10, implying that there are at least 26 different ways to deploy 10 satellites to monitor the Earth. Finally, we also show that the size of the minimum Identifying Code for the SBG is at least 9. Finally, we discuss some Identifying Code results in the geometric setting.
