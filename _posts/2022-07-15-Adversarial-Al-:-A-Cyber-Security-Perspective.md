Adversarial AI: A Cyber Security Perspective

## Abstract
In recent years, machine learning algorithms and, more specifically, deep learning algorithms have been widely used in many fields, including cyber security. However, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and this limits the application of machine learning, particularly in dynamic, adversarial environments, such as the cyber security domain where actual adversaries exist. This talk will shed light on the latest research on adversarial attacks against security solutions based on machine learning techniques. It will illuminate the risks they pose while illustrating the feasibility of launching adversarial attacks on security systems in general and cyber security systems in particular. The talk will also provide an overview of attacks on advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs), which are widely used by EVs like Tesla; surveillance systems, which are widely used at airports to detect suspects that appear on a blacklist; and malware classifiers, which are embedded in endpoint EDR and intrusion detection systems widely deployed at large organizations. 

## Biodata
Yuval Elovici is the director of the Telekom Innovation Laboratories at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), head of BGUâ€™s Cyber Security Research Center, and a professor in the Department of Software and Information Systems Engineering at BGU.
