Counting, Sampling, and Synthesis: The Quest for Scalability

## Abstract
The current generation of automated symbolic reasoning techniques excel at the qualitative tasks (i.e., when the answer is Yes or No) owing to the dramatic progress in satisfiability solving, also referred to as the SAT revolution. The advances in SAT afford us the luxury to focus on quantitative reasoning tasks, whose development is critical to reason about the increasingly interconnected and complex computing systems.

In this talk, I will discuss the design of the next generation of automated reasoning techniques to perform higher-order tasks such as quantification (aka counting), sampling of representative behavior, and automated synthesis of systems. Naturally, these tasks are hard from a complexity-theoretic viewpoint, and therefore, our frameworks focus on tight integration of real-world applications, beyond the worst-case analysis algorithmic design and data-driven system design. This has allowed us to achieve significant advances in counting, sampling, and synthesis, providing a new algorithmic toolbox in formal methods, probabilistic reasoning, databases, and design verification. I will discuss the core design principles and the utility of the above techniques on various real applications, including quantitative analysis of AI systems and critical infrastructure resilience estimation
