Counting, Sampling, and Synthesis: The Quest for Scalability

## Abstract
In this talk, we will survey one to three cryptographic notions of computation over encrypted data - fully homomorphic encryption, attribute-based encryption, and laconic functional evaluation - as well as their instantiations from lattices. The talk will focus on deriving a simple equation at the core of all of these constructions.
